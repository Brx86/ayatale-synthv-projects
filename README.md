# Ayatale-synthv-projects
This is a place where I share my Synthesizer V projects. I'm not a professional musician and I know nothing about music theories.
I play with Synthesizer V mostly for fun, and sharing the projects to help anyone who could be in help.
These files can also serve as example projects that you can start Synthesizer V with. Most of them (for now) would be using only Lite voice databases thus increasing the versatility.

Synthesizer V uses JSON for file storage.

The shared project files you can get are licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.

The purpose of sharing the project is to HELP you understand what I could do with Synthesizer V and help you learning to use the software.
Therefore whether the project I've created are permitted for monetizing or not (by software EULA), you may not monetize using any of my project files shared to you.
Thank you.
